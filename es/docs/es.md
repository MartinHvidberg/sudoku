# ES - EC SuDoKu

The EC SuDoKu module, Strictly Structured

Largely based on prior /sudoku/SuDoKu_* work, but a fresh start

**sdk_base**: A SuDoKu class with basic storage, visualisation, etc.

**sdk_coms**: Adds 'Solve Like A Computer' functionality

**sdk_hums**: Adds 'Solve Like A Human' functionality

**sdk_make**: All about making new SuDoKu'

**sdk_prmu**: All about permutations

**sdk_rank**: All about ranking

All have UT (Unit Test) classes, placed in ./tests/

Rely on dir ../data/* for test SuDoKu's. May later move to ./data/*, but so far shared with other SuDoKu projects, so...

Hopefully don't rely on anything else
