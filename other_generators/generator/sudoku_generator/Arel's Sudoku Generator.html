Sudoku is a logic based placement puzzle, also known as Number Place 
        in the United States. The aim of the puzzle is to enter a numerical 
        digit from 1 through 9 in each cell of a 9*9 grid made up of 3*3 subgrids 
        (called "regions"), starting with various digits given in some 
        cells (the "givens"). Each row, column, and region must contain 
        only one instance of each numeral. Completing the puzzle requires patience 
        and logical ability. Its grid layout is reminiscent of other newspaper 
        puzzles like crosswords and chess problems. Although first published in 
        1979, Sudoku initially became popular in Japan in 1986 and attained international 
        popularity in 2005. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Read

Below is a simple program written to generate Sudoku puzzles. It was written 
        in python (in the matter of a few hours so please excuse its inelegance). 
        To run it, just type <code>python sudoku.py</code> at the command line 
        or use your favorite python interpreter.<p></p>
      <p>Creating (and solving) these puzzles is a constraint satisifaction problem, 
        which in general is a hard thing. However, this program takes advantage 
        of the fact that most CSPs aren't hard in the average case.</p></td>
