My SuDoKu attempt...
Focus is on solving by logic, using the same tactics as apply to manual (human brain) solving.
Eventually I hope to be able to 'rate' a sudoku, based on how complex tactics is needed to solve it.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Configuration = Just clone and run
* Dependencies = None, other than Python
* How to run tests = Run the included UnitTest
